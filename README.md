# ECG-Heartbeat-Classification
Code for ECG heartbeat classification using a hybrid Multi-Input 1D CNN and Random Forest model
# ECG Heartbeat Classification Using Multi-Input 1D CNN and Random Forest

This repository contains the code for the paper "ECG Heartbeat Classification Using Multi-Input 1D CNN and Random Forest: A Spiral Approach" 

## Overview
This project develops a hybrid model to classify ECG heartbeats into five categories (Normal, Supraventricular, Ventricular, Fusion, Unknown) using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The model combines a Multi-Input 1D CNN and Random Forest, achieving an F1-score > 0.80 for all classes.

## Files
- `ECG_Classification.ipynb`: Main notebook with the code.


## How to Run
1. Open `ECG_Classification.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
3. Run all cells to train the model and generate results.
